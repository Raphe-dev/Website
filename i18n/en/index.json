Taking advantage of a templating framework like Vue we develop every aspect of a site or app in an independent box also known as a component that we can test independently and make sure it's rock solid. It is very important to insure code uniformity through linter, code formatter and never forget DevOps for auto-deploys and codebase management."

That makes you save time and money, it might even be free. But don't get me wrong big projects often need a complex backend architecture and it can be less of a headache to have a node.js server running on amazon, digital ocean, ibm, etc."
